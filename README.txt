This is an app which shows the popular actor in the list.
In order to import this app, you do not need to change anything, you can click import projects from android studio, and choose this folder. However, in order to run it, you need to take API from themoviedb website. Some security reasons, I must delete mine, however, you can take API token from website and insert it.
While implementing this, I get lots of helps from this youtuber called Delaroy Studios. (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ00VgbuL3218mXA0_drptg) 
I even talked him via e-mail. 


I couldn't do the second part of the task, because while I was implementing until this part, I had also to study my final exams. However, most problematic part of taking datas and inserting it is correct in some sense.
You can also check (Deplike ideas.txt). While I was using it, I see some problematic parts of it. I wrote all my ideas.

Thank you, and I hope we will see each other in future plans.
