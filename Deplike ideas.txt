Deplike Ideas
I have an iPhone 6 Plus, so what I faced is on this smart phone, I don't know it's the same with Android phones/tablets. I also used Irig HD and Fender American Stratocaster.
For ios, while I wanted to use my tones in Garageband, system do not open it in Garageband. When I tried to firstly open Garageband and choose the Deplike, Garageband did not open it and says the system do not found. Therefore, Deplike is not adapted to Garageband, and I believe, most of the users who records bunch of song are sorry for this.
I plugged my electric guitar via Irig HD, however (without headphones) it gives too less noise from the speaker of phone. I heard too less noise when my phones volume is at maximum. 
Lastly, Looper is good, but you cannot add another record on one loop and I believe it causes some stability problems for guitarist. As you know well, when you push the screen to start loop, it does starts immediately, and it takes time to take your pick and start playing.
I hope I do not exceed one's authority or go beyond the limit. I just wanted to give some ideas and problems while I was playing with Deplike and I do believe that its background is awesome, the sound quality, the realistic pedal board system, THAT CHORUS, I think the fundamental background is amazing and I enjoyed most of the tones what I created and others.
Thanks for everything.
